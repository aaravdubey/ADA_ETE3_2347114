Amazing stay,"Had a lovely stay at this resort and could not have asked for a better 2 weeks. We visited for our honeymoon and we could not have been looked after enough. The staff were so friendly and on hand to help if we needed anything The hotel was clean and our rooms were cleaned daily by vaibhav and Suraj who did a good job The pool staff were so helpful and always asking if you wanted drinks It had a bar which was stocked with most things and the dinner in the evening was a Buffet although an al a carte was also available. The buffet had a good choice of vegetable options, meat and fish and they had both spicy and non spicy options. The al a carte menu also had some home comfort foods such as burger, pizza and pastas if you are worried about there not being anything like that! There is a shop a 30 second walk away which sells most things you could want - only small but convenient and run by a lovely man. There is also a clothes shop, jewellery shop and a pharmacy like place. The beach is right there also and is a lovely clean quiet beachIf you are going to venture out the hotel does have a taxi on site the whole time but they do charge over double what it should be - we got hold of some local numbers and whatsapped them to set up a time and they were very helpful and cheap (about 300 rupee for a 15 min journey) +91 97301 15565 or +91 70288 22221",5,December 2019
Excellent Stay,"We stayed here for our honeymoon end of December into January and had the most wonderful stay. Our room was lovely - we did go for the suite and it was very clean and was cleaned everyday by vaibhav and suraj We received excellent service by the pool also with the two pool staff always asking if we wanted a drink or anything and was very friendly and helpful The restaurant was also very good and we enjoyed the food - it was a buffet but had lots of choice for both meat eaters And veg eaters and also hot food and not so spicy food. They also had a fish option and soup and bread. There was also an al a crate available if you fancied something different or comfort food such as pizza , burgers etc The location was also good with the beach being right at the end of the resort and there was also a few little shops just a 30 second walk from the hotel. A food and drink shop with a very friendly owner which sold most things , a jewellery shop, clothes shop and a pharmacy like place There are also taxis available on the premises although I heard these were very expensive so if you can get a localOne that is better The staff were also couldn‚Äôt be friendlier - very helpful always and cheeryWe also stayed here for New Year‚Äôs Eve which was the most amazing experience. We did not know what to expect but there is a huge buffet with world foods and anything you could want, music and activities.Overall fantastic stay and would thoroughly recommend",5,December 2019
Great resort,"We really loved our staying at Royal Orchid. The staff was very helpful, we managed to get a room upgrade for a competitive pricing, the housekeeping staff did an excellent job at cleaning the room and leaving towel artwork by Rajat Kurtikar. The bar is open 24/7 and the food can be ordered only up to 10:30pm. The food is excellent, best tempura shrimps ü¶ê and fish fingers in Goa! The breakfast buffet is also very good. Overall, strongly recommended.",5,January 2020
Feedback,We visited along with two kids.overall experience is fabulous. Rooms are quite big. Food is awesome. It's on a very neat and clean and less crowded beach- Utraoda beach. Most important the staff - is very warm for services. Best was housekeeping staff who made overall experience great in providing extra metress for making two bedrooms. Last but not least Mr. Rajat from housekeeping has ensured room is extremely well organised every day. Andd he has also amazed us by doing every day creative room decoration work by towels and flowers.we will surely love to visit again.,5,January 2020
Three star passed as a Five star,"It is a shame I have to rate a 4.5 rated property by all fellow trip advisor buffs 3. I did not want to commit the mistake of others who found this place decent without realising they paid a 5 star rate for a 3 star property.First we landed in this place to find that the road was their parking. The reception shot they have on the side is a narrow corridor leading to reception by the roadside. Well we landed in a reception which was a 200 sq ft cramped place with a lobby which ended like a large suite.  The swimming pool picture shot so well, which we did not dip into in 2 days was a shaped pool fit for a small apartment.  If you can imagine it is a really small property with excellent photography which can fool a discerning eye.So what impressed was their rooms with a separate bedroom with a tucked in dressing space , corridor leading to a drawing space with bathroom in between with luxurious balconies.  Not sure if all rooms are so big but what we got was good. The beach access is excellent with a nice beach with a lot of shacks and food options so a  top rating for that. The breakfast was poorer than a 3 star just better than a bread and breakfast lodging with a few more options but max 10 thing on the buffet and they rate themselves 5 star.  They need to at least change this which they can.  Surprising Goa has not ensured uniform standards of rating allowing such average stay resorts from rating themselves as 5 star.  Room service is average, food quality just about average and overall landscape average.  Mind you for a three star I would rate this place 4-5 but not when you pay 10000 bucks for the night with many proper 5 star properties like Caravela or Majorda around.Not advised for families with small kids or large groups as this place has nothing good to offer except the rooms. Not going to come back here as it is not worth the money",3,January 2020
Good hotel,"Friendly atmosphere, good service, very cool location - 5 minutes walk to the beach, 20 minutes to downtown, great food, large adult pool and small for kids (see photo), gym and SPA, 2  places for volleyball. Very interesting feature - for 14 days on the territory of the hotel were spent 5 marriages, and on the beach we saw them almost every day (but this is not a minus). The cleaners of our room were especially liked, always invented and decorated with something new - Kanaj &amp; Sanford and Basoraj (hopefully spelled names).  I recommend the hotel for all parameters. Spent incredible days in Goa.",5,February 2020

Awesome Family Place,"The resort has great facilities to engage. For family or group of friends it's ideal. Swimming pool, proximity to the beach, garden, football, air hockey, fussball, games room and lot many things to indulge.Staff is very courteous and friendly. Nilufer at the front desk was really helpful and provided with a room upgrade at a reasonable price.Food has a decent variety however the taste of South Indian dishes can be improved upon.Overall an awesome vacation place and one stop destination to relax and unwind.",5,February 2020
Stay in luxury,"It was a very nice stay with my 2 small kids aged 2 and 4 , extremely satisfied, got upgraded from luxury suit to Royal plunge!!!!. Awesome. Had baby milk and meal on demand anytime of day. Kids enjoyed pool area and the Utorda Beach which was nearby , clean one. Had gone with breakfast and dinner , breakfast was sumptuous and very good, dinner could have been better with more options. Staff were ever smiling and we're very courteous and room service service was prompt. Lots of shacks nearby on beach where you can lounge all day and enjoy drinks at reasonable rates. Beach Sports activities within walking distance on beach. Had done pars-sailing and jetskiing",5,March 2020
Affordable Luxury on the beach.,i always love staying on beach front properties when visiting Goa.so this time came across this nice boutique resort in south goa with an amazing beachfront.The booking process was quite easy with good deals online and also was in touch with the executive sumitra and nita from the hotel to make my booking special as it was also my daughters birthday.Coming to the resort its quite close by from the airport approx 20 mins and charges from prepaid taxi is around 700/-.the reception area is decently sized with a good view of the pool and the lawns.the check-in was smooth with a refreshing welcome drink.we were appointed the club rooms with a balcony as we had asked.The rooms and bathroom are decently sized with a good balcony overlooking the lawns and pool.The beach is a 5 min walk through the property lawns which are beautiful with ducks lazying around.As of now only one restaurant named Cosmos was operational with good ac and a good sitout overlooking the swimming pool and far away view of the sean and the sand.(lovely it was ) The pool was well maintained and had a sunken bar which was nice.Coming to the plus pointsStaff was really sweet and always had a smile. Special mention for Ranjan and lokesh in the restaurant.suzana anita and Franseca on the reception.Sumitra for the booking and making sure what i wanted was all available with a yummy cake for my daughter.The breakfast had a good spread and ala carte options were quite yummy as well.had 4 meals and all of them were quite tasty.Things that can be improved.Please have a mat at the door to dust the sand and also a mat around the bed as the floor can get a little dusty and sandy after coming from the beach.The balcony chairs could have been a little more comfortable.Have a beach side restaurant or atleast a cafe so as to avoid the shack on the beach.all in all a good resort and wworth every penny spent.Thank you to Royal orchid team to make our holiday memorable.,4,November 2021
Beautiful hotel & beach,Me and my husband had a perfect holiday in goa. The hotel was lovely . Very pretty reception area which we enjoyed sitting in trying the amazing cocktails. Our room was cleaned every day by Rajat and ruzan  who did a good job and decorated our room with colourful flowers and made it fun.  The beach is beautiful with its white powder sand and it was our favourite spot for sunbathing and swimming,5,January 2020
Mid range hotel well positioned on beach.,"Decent hotel well positioned on Utorda Beach. Good restaurant and first class breakfast choice ( beware many stairs to first floor restaurant ). Limited activities on site but small water park for children and pretty good pool ( highlight being the two pool guys Shridhar &amp; Pradeep who are always friendly, attentive and willing to help ). Hotel perhaps needs a little TLC but staff are generally good and rooms competitively priced but vary in size &amp; quality. Can be a bit noisy until late if Indian Wedding booked. Few shops and lots of nearby beach shacks, particularly Baltons which is worth a visit or two. Must be good as we have booked again for Feb / Mar 2000...",4,February 2019
Nice location but disappointing overall,"The location is nice, but the cleanliness of room/bathroom and the training of food service staff leaves a lot to be desired.  Specifically, the hotel is located close to a great beach.  The room was not very clean -- the A/C was blowing stale air (maybe the filter needed a change) and the bathroom was smelly and had a lot of bugs/insects that I got bitten by.  The food service staff in Cosmos, a rather overpriced restaurant, was not very well-trained.  They ignored me most of the time, all the way from getting seated to getting a drinks order or offering roti or such.  I had to walk over each time to get their attention although there were several of them standing around, not particularly busy at all times.  It may be a function of poor training or low pay.  The food was okay, nothing to write home about.  On the balcony seating, I noticed numerous ants crawling right under the glass covering on the table.  The baggage staff and the security guys were very helpful and were perhaps the main people who went out of their way and made my stay okay.  Otherwise, my rating would have been even lower.  Disappointing hotel overall.",3,January 2020
Average at best,"Royal Orchid Resort has several things going for it but they don‚Äôt leverage it to its potential. The location is great : 25-30 mins from Airport, connected to a nice beach, plenty of Shacks if you travel in the season and the food is better than many other luxury hotels in South Goa. Where they mess up big time is in cleanliness and hygeine. The towels, bed linen will have several marks, they don‚Äôt provide towels on the beach, housekeeping takes forever to be done during the day ( evening). Hygeine is non - negotiable in Covid times but they don‚Äôt seem to be taking it seriously. I understand that they don‚Äôt charge a bomb, but nobody will care about a slightly higher price for a cleaner and safer experience.",4,December 2021
Wonderful property and Quality of food is excellent.,"We started our honeymoon (Although this wasn't a honeymoon package) and checked in on the 27th  with this hotel in Utroda and didn't know what to expect. We thought from the photos that the hotel is far away from the beach but it really isn't too much of a bother, its easily accessible and a leisurely walk away. The property is well maintained and the cleanliness was top notch. Although we were looking forward to use the pool or avail some spa services, we were informed that due to the Covid pandemic, these services are currently closed.  Our room was on the smaller side but we found it agreeable. there was also a sit out with cane chairs that we liked very much.The shining star of the hotel, that we felt was the amazing food served at all times. The Breakfast buffet had a lot of variety and was quite lip-smacking, A la carte also exceeded expectations. My compliments to the kitchen team. The staff at the hotel were all very cordial and greeted us with a smile every time. The serving staff at the restaurant  very efficient and we were very pleased with the service.The beach from the hotel is quite accessible and clean, maybe due to the pandemic there was a lull in the number of people but we enjoyed the low numbers. I would definitely recommend this hotel as well as look forward to visit at some point in the future.",5,November 2020
A Note of appreciation for a great  hospitality by Team of Royal Orchid Goa.,"We stayed at the Royal Orchid Beach Resort in the second week of  October 2021. We caught the monsoons and it rained heavily while we were there. But luckily there were enough spells of sunshine to enjoy the day.Our first day at the resort was a surprise for my hubby as we married during lockdown and it was perfectly arranged with the help of Mr Samarth and his team of Ashpak ,Ramesh &amp; Stanford they did a great bed decor on a very short notice, I am so grateful for the arrangements. We stayed on the ground floor in a villa and we loved the location, cleanliness, and privacy.The beach is about 100 m away, you can walk through  garden pathway of the resort through the delightful gardens. The beach is clean and peaceful and even there are no  hawkers to bother you. The breakfast spread was quite expansive ranging from fruit juices to breads, to Indian, and continental cuisines. Live counters for eggs, pancakes, and dosa. And some unique dishes like Goan Poiee, and Oriental dishes.The entire property is gorgeous; the reception is beautiful followed by a swimming pool. The gardens are lush and well-maintained,with ducks roaming around the gardens. I particularly appreciated the smooth transition of requests especially by Housekeeping &amp; Service which made it so easy for us to manage our asks during the stay.Would definitely be back here!",5,October 2021
With all my team at Royal orchid,The happiness was after getting to know that my colleagues they had a pleasant time. The royal orchid staff made it. Provided the best possible services which I could ever ask forFront desk staff are very cooperative. Nilufer helped me with the printouts.a thing to remmember was very helpfulFransquinha was helpful at the time of checkoutHousekeeping did their good job. By keeping our rooms mainatained.Prakash was helpful too,5,February 2020
Awesome Experience,"We stayed here for 3 days and I must say it was a wonderfull stay, Food is tasty and morning buffet breakfast used to be our favrioute part of the day :)We booked our stay with dinner also, which was also good.Property construction is bit old but outside ares like garden, pool area, landscaping they have maintained very well.Utroda beach is just right behind the resort and you will have direct access to beach by 5 min walk, beach was very clean and less crowded, it felt like private beach :)",4,January 2021
Nice Stay,"We stayed in this property for 1 night on the 13th Feb in room no 403. Welcoming was warm and the reception staff were good.The room was small but there was some smell in the room. The balcony was not that clean. I think Housekeeping staff or the reception would have checked the room before allotting.On 14th at the time of breakfast, i ordered for Masal Dosa and the same was served to me cold. I told them to get the fresh one. i knew beforehand that they will warm up the same dosa and will serve me again, so i went up to the live counter and it was exactly what i thought, they were getting the same Dosa. then i told them to get me the new one. I think this was not at all right from the service staff.One more thing which i wanted to bring to the management notice that every hotel have some guidelines for the swimming pool. i saw at this property any one can enter the pool with any cloths. I saw people in the pool with T shirts, pants, Banyan. This is really bad and i think hotel should take a call on this. I have deducted 2 points on Pool and the service staff in the restaurant and have to think twice before coming to this property.",3,February 2020
Stayed happily without complains,"Compair with other hotels we stayed with Royal Orchid without complains. Room was cleaned well by housekeeping team .Prakash who take care of kids in providing fish food in the morning, fish feeding activity make feel differently. Activities are more in this property to make kids engaged.",5,January 2021
Beach resort,"Really good experience overall. Rooms were sanitized before arrival and all levels hygiene standards were maintained throughout the resort. The breakfast,lunch and dinner buffet was lipsmacking and delicious! Direct access to Utorda beach made it very easy to spend lots of time at the beach which was really pretty! Will definitely revisit because of the wonderful experience!",5,December 2020
Family vacation for Anniversary,"Had an amazing stay overall. I was disappointed initially when the room they offered me hadn't met my choices which I asked them while booking. However to our surprise they had upgraded our  club room to Luxury Suite room for free of cost. The hospitality and room service has been excellent throughout our stay. They have been very generous to make amazing floral and balloon decorations complimentary for my kid's birthday. Coming to food, they have great buffet breakfast and also taken care of my little one with their in-house food preparation. The resort also has great ambience overall and we have had a pleasantful stay. I would strongly recommend  to everyone including families. Only issue- The cabs available in the vicinity are very expensive. The hotel can look at options in providing transport facilities at reasonable prices for tourists to roam around.",5,January 2020
superb stay ,It was an amazing stay very nice resort.pool is very well maintained lawn area is very clean with ducks. room cleaning done was very nice and clean with towel art done by clinton mario kanaya sanford and rajit housekeeping supervisor was very helpful and taken good care of rooms.food wss very tasty with difrent dishes..,5,February 2020
South Goa Trip,"The trip was with my friends, we booked three rooms club category and got adjacent rooms. The clean beach close to property makes you feels calm  relaxed. Booked the boat cruise online more expensive please request 5o book from hotel itself",5,March 2021
Goa Trip,It was an awesome trip to goa breaking the pandemic blues. Royal orchid resort was really nice in conducting the guests and their safety. The food at the restaurant is very tasty and hygienic. I strongly recommend this place for couples and family.,5,October 2020
Amazing place which provides a peaceful stay!,"My family was longing for a holiday, which could help us relax as well as provide warmth. When we checked into the hotel, we got a very warm welcome from the front desk team. We had already informed that my son is a differently abled, who has walking issues and had requested for a room on the ground floor. However, this being the season for weddings, though we had given our specifications, we could not get the kind of room we preferred. We were a bit disappointed, but to our surprise, the staff were very courteous and upgraded us to a much better room without charging us anything extra!This gave us a view that they are customer-centric and felt very happy about our decision on choosing this resort for our 6-day stay. The entire place is amazing with the Utorda beach right behind the property. With my handicapped son, we would walk up to the beach everyday and spend our calm evenings watching the sunset and sipping a cup of tea from the beach shacks. The beach is very less populated, and hence once can have a very pleasant beach experience.Breakfast, lunch and dinner options at the restaurant was very good, and we foodies enjoyed every veg options available. My son enjoyed their ice creams and desserts. Adding to that, they had live music everyday, both in the morning and evenings, which would make our breakfast and lunch even more enjoyable!The housekeeping and the room service staff were also very helpful, and would attend to the customer's needs even at the odd hours!On the whole, I would like to sum up that if you are looking for a place that can comfort you, help you get relaxed, and make you feel @ home,  then this is the place to be!",5,November 2022
Great hospitality,"Stay is very comfortable. Staff is very professional and helpful, especially housekeeping staff is very nice and quick. Great service. Nice amenities and good variety of breakfast. Pool services are nice, pradeep from pool team was very good. Fransquinha was very helpful at reception desk. We had great stay.",4,February 2020
Comfortable stay,"We had a lovely stay at Royal Orchid. We had a family of 4 with children aged 1 and 4 years. We enjoyed breakfast. The pool side and going to the beach at sunset. Vaibhav and Niraj got really efficient at cleaning our rooms and left a nice crafted animal on the bed once cleaned. Fransquinha checked us in and was delughtful. However we were unhappy we were asked to pay in full upon checkin. We had the best view from our balcony room 422. We felt safe as there were lots of families and there was a guard at the beach entrance. There were lots of restaurants within walking distance so in the evening we'd take a stroll out. At the spa my husband enjoyed the bali massage and went twice. My 4 year old loved the children's Christmas party and didnt want to leave. Also a special mention to the pool man who put on the fountains on, on our last day.",5,December 2019
Awesome,The over all ambience of the resort is very peaceful and holistic the breakfast menu the lunch and dinner was awesome housekeeping is at its best. Overall the front desk officers staff including the pickup chuggers were very kind polite and extremely helpful. After Covid pendemic I really enjoyed my stay her and I m sure all ither guest will also receprocate my views. To be specific I would like to mention Fransquinha Pradeep Shridhar Praksh Anil and Kheem Chef. There are all more of all family members  Good buy royal orchid staff Regard Shankar,5,March 2021

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again !!",5,September 2020
"This hotel is like a ""Treat right near the beach""","Inspite of this Covid situation and delays , I would like to acknowledge Mr. Kapil for his above and beyond call of duty. And Mr. Supreyo, an amazing person to have at the dining area. The way he attends and checks on his guest every 5-10mins , making sure there is nothing shortage or mishaps faces by any of his guest  is the quality I admired. Hotel rooms are well maintained, all measures taken to avoid the spread of Covid. Huge effort and courage. Well done team....ü•Ç",4,October 2020
Nice place for a family vacation..,"I spent about 4 days here in the resort and I would say overall it was a pleasant experience. The resort is clean and well maintained. Safety and health aspects are well taken care of..The beach is just two mins walk from the resort and clean.. The food in the restaurant is also very tasty and good. A bit over priced but guess the quality and taste compensates for the price.. The service of the restaurant staff is also very good especially Ryan, Ranjit and Lokesh.. They are very courteous and serve you very well.. Buffet has a good spread with choices for veg and non veg..Service of the resort is good but there is room for improvement.. The first day we had to call multiple times to get our room cleaned or any request to the reception had to be at least 3 to 4 calls before they could attend us.However, this changed from day 2. I had escalated the issue to Suzanne(guest relation officer of the resort) and she promptly listened to the issues and resolved everything.. Post this, there was no issues, Everything was good and handled well.. Thanks to Suzanne for helping out..Also Frances at the reception is very helpful.. The check in and check out was smooth. Overall, I will recommend the resort.. Value for money and a great place for a family vacation..",4,November 2021
Stay cool have fun,Very good and very well maintained all properties... Swimming pool is not so deep so children will not drawn Beach is by walking distance and it's also neat. Children love to feed fish and Ducks.Staying here is pleasure...,5,March 2021
"Excellent Hotel, worth 5 Star ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê!","Excellent Hotel, 5 star for us. Booked a suite (for a family of 4) for 5 nights, worth the price, and service equivalent tto any 5 star resorts in South Goa. walking distance from the back gate to Utorda Beach, relatively calm, less crowded and one of the cleanest and white sand beaches in South GoaGood food, offer multiple options except fresh catch sea food that one can visit multiple restaurant options.",5,January 2023
Wonderful Staff! 5* Hospitality. Will return !!!,"This is the 2nd time we are visiting the hotel and will continue to come back due to the amazing staff. All the staff make a huge effort to ensure we are enjoying ourselves and have everything we need.The pool attendants Pradip and Shridhra are absolutely fantastic! In the mornings when I approach the swimming pool they are already out laying the towel on my sunbed for me and family and they know which sun beds we like! Not only this but we get a very welcoming greeting from them always. Also, whenever we go in the pool they ensure we have a ball to play with and put the fountains on. So a very big thank you to both the pool attendants for making our time round the pool so relaxing and enjoyable always.The housekeeping staff have also been incredible! Everyday is exciting coming back to the room to see which towel animals have been left. A special thank you to Ishwar, Rohit and Kanay!!!! They have done a fantastic job of cleaning our room everyday and making it look beautiful.The resort is lovely and the grounds are well kept. The location is 5* with one of the most beautiful beaches right on the doorstep.All in all, it is the staff who make this hotel a wonderful stay! So thank you to everyone who has been so very friendly. I do believe there needs to be some renovation around the rooms to improve the quality but despite this, I will still continue to return.",5,January 2020
More than worse,"Such a pathetic and overpriced property...hair strands on pillows, washroom so unhygienic, no management.Looks like a 2-star property. Even one more family was disappointed with the hotel at the reception. Such a weak management, they gave late check in because rooms were not ready and when you enter the room you will be surprised with stained washrooms, hairs over pillows and blanket. Literally spoiled my spouse surprise birthday trip. They should literally shut down for a while for immediate maintenance.",1,January 2021
5 star resort with 3 star mindset,"I don‚Äôt know whether it was our over expectation or there bellow standard delivery but our stay at Royal Orchid Utorda was not pleasant. Club room is very small and extremely average we upgraded to Luxury Suit the next day. It was 107 room number. Moment we entered we could feel the strong damp smell, feel like room was unused and locked for long. At night after visiting the beach when we came back and switched on AC it was raining cockroaches from the ac. We switched off the ac and informed the front desk immediately. Behaviour of staffs was also not 5 star standard. We could not finish our pint beer so before leaving hotel we thought to finish the last bottle and go, we asked for an opener to AKSHAY a lobby staff he said as it was bought from outside, bar attender refused to give opener it seems. I could not believe my ears. I paid more than lakhs for 2 rooms in 3 days and they don‚Äôt even have this much courtesy!!! And yes, when we upgraded the room I requested the front desk for 2 days complimentary breakfast as our bill already came high , they called me after 4 hours and informed resort is offering me special discounts, when I calculated it was Rs. 200 discount for me. Seriously they can me more generous and customer friendly. They demand they are 5 star but mindset wise they are still 3 star only. Well to be honest, it was all not bad indeed. Amenities are good, Wi-Fi is good, location is excellent, they have private beach with beach side shacks (go to Beltons not the other one) , para sailing and other water activities also happen there itself, pool is good. Water park kids really enjoyed, they have PS4 stations for kids.",3,January 2022
Excellent and Perfect trip and a perfect family gateway,"What's better than the amazing landscape and beautiful views Royal Orchid property has to offer?What's better than the delicious food that was prepared by all the skilled chefs?What's better than the cozy villas surrounded by greenery?It would have to be the impeccable hospitality!!From the very first step that you take into this property, you are greeted with the most energetic smile that you can see right through the mask of the wonderful Guest Manager Samarth, his every effort going into making every moment at the property an absolute treat for you and your family. Accompanied by an army of help from Ramesh, Bernardo &amp; Melbon he made sure that our rooms were clean and well sanitized and our every moment was an absolute delight. Thanks to GRE Suzanne at reception. Highly recommended  for family, friends and couples",5,October 2021
Excellent place to stay with family,"We had stayed for a couple of days. This is a place which is very well suited for family. The kids have choices to keep themselves busy too. The staff (Fransquinha, Suvarna and other staff) are very courteous and extremely helpful. All the staff we wearing masks all the time. The vegetarian food is excellent and we did not find any need to think of alternatives at any point in time. All the staff in the restaurant Cosmos are extremely courteous and professional. The location is also very good with the Uttorda beach just about two-minute walk from the back gate of the property.",5,December 2020
"Good reams, great staff, can more more friendly for limited mobility guests","Post Covid-19 lockdowns, Royal Orchid has done a really good job quickly to bring this resort up to speed in making it comfortable and safe for guests. The place has good rooms (double rooms too small though), absolutely great staff (front desk, restaurant as well as housekeeping). The place is also close to the beach having some wonderful sunset views. One gap in the place is it makes it difficult for people with limited mobility. The restaurant is on the first floor with no lifts, the ground floor rooms are not slotted for limited mobility guests - would be a good idea for staff to ask this explicitly during reservations or mark it separately while booking.",4,October 2020
Good and Comfortable stay,"A location closer to the beach with private access. Good food. Rooms are small but for 2 it is manageable. Check in was fast and so was check out. Room service can be improved and so does housekeeping.Do not engage services of nearby 2 wheeler vendor, a liquor shop, both Husband and wife are the most uncourteous and they give you a feeling that you are being given a favor so avoid them.",4,April 2022
Hotel which is peaceful and cosy,"Ok, so if I need to give stars to the hotel only, then I will give 4 stars. Stay in luxury suite. Avoid club room. It's a very small room. Though it's a beach resort, but there aren't any rooms with a beach view. Though u can view the ocean from all other location in the resort, except from the rooms. Have given 5 stars for the hospitality of the staff. The staff is always smiling, especially Mr Girish of reception. All the staff are always ready to help. The room service, room cleaning is quick. The breakfast and buffet spread is adequate though not lavish, but whatever there is, the food tastes really good. The staff is always trying to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. Location of the hotel is perfect, if u want a. Peaceful resort which is near to all attractions but away of the hustle bustle of North Goa. They are adding more facilities for the kids. The main pool is 4 ft throughout, so small kids can swim without much fear and they provide u the tubes as well. Utorda beach is quite near, with the access from the hotel. The beach is neat, clean, safe, with water sports as well. The only thing which the hotel management needs to work upon are the club rooms and some ocean facing rooms.",5,October 2021
"Nothing beyond ordinary, direct access to beach only high ","Food is a big issue, especially for vegetarians. There are very few shacks which order below average food, the hotel itselfs offers  limited buffet and food(Veg) is truly below average at best. Overall location is good, room size is small and pricing is on higher side.Staff is good, cleanliness is apt, there are marriage functions held in the compound which can be instrusive because of increased footfall on such ocassions",4,March 2022
Good service overrules the property,"The property is very close to the beach and the beach is pretty clean  with good access to sports/beach shacks. The restaurant service/quality was good . However , the rooms could do with a little bit of uplift as the furnishings seems dated.",4,February 2020
Appearances can be deceptive,"You may want to judge a book by its cover but in the case of this resort, you would be sorely amiss. The drab property frontage does an amazing job of concealing the important beyond, which gently keeps peeling away at ever more revelatory discoveries. Starting with a curious walkway over a lengthy fish pond, this resort aims to lay sufficient credence to the fact that less is indeed more. The compact lobby immediately gives you an idea that there‚Äôs a lot to be discovered yonder and this begins with directions to the only on site restaurant, which is situated above. The aptly named Cosmos immediately provides an elevated vantage point from where the senses are sufficiently enticed to explore all that this property has to offer. Aside from the usual buffet, which is sufficient considering the paucity of space, the true gem is the a la carte menu. The kitchen and serving staff are an amazing bunch of efficient souls who ensure that you never truly miss the lack of choice in food zones. The utilization of space is to be marveled at wherein the property has managed to include a lobby, lounge and restaurant with deck all in the same building. From here, once you commence your walk to the rooms and beyond, you‚Äôre greeted by the lovely pool area that has a cute little sunken bar to make the most of the languid pace that this resort follows in everything it does. We chose the Luxury Suites and it was a decision that we never once regretted during the length of our stay. Irrespective of whether one chooses the ground or first floor, the rooms make it special in terms of what‚Äôs on offer both inside and out. Each of these rooms had a balcony or a porch and the flow within was generous for a walkabout. There‚Äôs a nice long stroll to be enjoyed over undulating land to finally reach the beach where you will find plenty of shacks catering to all finds of F&amp;B needs. The beach isn‚Äôt private but the access to the same from the property is direct and that‚Äôs what really matters. A minimum stay of 3 nights is required to truly absorb all that this property has to offer including efficient arrangement of short notice tours of the city. Last, but definitely not the least, do sample some of the delectable fares that their in house bakery has to offer in addition to the sumptuous spread of F&amp;B choices.",5,April 2022

Excellent place to relax,"Situated at Utorda beach, 30 minutes from the airport. Here‚Äôs the feedback based on my experience:Location: On the beach, resort has its own walkway to the beach. Staff: Excellent, good behaviorFood: We opted for buffet breakfast, lunch, dinner. Fresh, lots of options and tasty.Room: Club rooms are smaller in size but there are suites with bigger area. We had a balcony facing pool, garden, rain dance floor.Activities: Lots of activities like air hockey, PS4, archery, carrom, foosball, paint ball shooting, box cricket, fish/duck feeding and of course swimming poolMusic: We stayed from Monday to Friday and during that time, they had live music only on one day. I asked few times and then they did arrange it on that day. Commute: Taxi stand outside the resortOthers: In room snacks, drinks and bar items are very costly. There are a couple of stores just a minute walk where you can buy snacks, drinks, chocolates etc. Overall, it was a relaxing stay and would love to visit again.",4,March 2022

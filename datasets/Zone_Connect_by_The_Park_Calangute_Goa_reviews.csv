Understanding and Caring Staff,Booked this hotel for our stay in North Goa and we never regretted. Staff at from desk is warm and courteous and is accomodating. We requested an early check in around 12 and the same was offered. The room size is decent and the washroom are spacious. Housekeeping person was very pro at his work and followed up on his own to clean the room. The food from room service was also tasty and the order used to take only 15 minutes. This hotel focusses a lot on guest satisfaction and thats the best thing which would make me recommend it to others,5,March 2021
Very Good,"The hotel has an impressive set up - swimming pool area, large breakfast and dining area, games room, spa facilities, etc. The only drawback would be its location, especially during the busy period. A cab is required to go to Calangute or Baga beach, which is difficult during the festive season.",4,December 2019
Vacation in Goa,"Nice, comfy, clean, and convenient place near Calangute beach.We stayed here for 5 days and it was an unforgettable experience. Everything was so perfect - comfy beds, clean washroom &amp; room,complimentary breakfast, and properly sanitized property.Azzure by Spree is one of the amazing properties for hassle free stay in North Goa. ☑️Spacious and luxurious rooms with 24*7 room service.☑️provide pickup and drop facility to airport at nominal charges☑️Ample of scooty parking area☑️Proper safety measures were taken☑️Pool is available,but due to COVID guidelines they didn't allow anyoneto enter the swimming pool☑️Room balconies to enjoy your morning and evening drinksLastly,their staff is friendly and cooperative.

Perfect!,"The service was awesome! The staff guided me with the best places to do water sports. The reception was nice. However, the location is a bit tacky cause it is far away from any of the beaches which makes renting a bike necessary. Overall, a good hotel.",5,February 2020
Very clean and supporting staff,Breakfast osm also give  early check in and very near to calungut beach and center to area hotel supporting staff and timely cleaning service. Best for couple and family..very large room and nice facilities,5,December 2021
Value for money and beautiful property and best staff,"We have stayed here for the second time for 4n ,the room was are super clean, the staff is very courteous and friendly and will always greet you with a smile and available 24/7. The food is priced well and so is the quality. The staff took extra efforts to cook safe and hygenic food for our 1.5 yrs old toddler. Overall Mr Prithiviraj and his are by the best at hospitality. We had a lovely experience at zone connect calangute and thoroughly enjoyed all the amenities at the hotel.",5,August 2022
Traveller,"The location is easily accessible, the staffs are very polite and to be my bad day I was locked up myself in the balcony and the staff coordinated with me through balcony immediately they arranged the Technical Person @ 10pm night. The food was really awesome especially we can get South Indian foods like Idly, vada, Rava upma and semiya Upma. Early checkin and checkout is available according to the booking if you request them.  The Calangute Beach, Aquada Fort, Baga beach is very near to the hotel  within 5km radius.",5,August 2022
Zone connect stay,"A perfect stay with great hospitality combined with superb food.Maria was extremely helpful throught out, Harsh from housekeeping was supportive in getting all the things we required. Pool was an absolute delight to be in with clear n clorine free water.",5,August 2022
We had a blast all thanks to this lovely staff!,"We checked in during late November and stayed here until the early days of December and it was one of the most comfortable stays ever! The breakfast was amazing, everyday and the room service was always very nice. The staff at the reception desk is very warm and the ones working over at their café are the best! Even the drivers associated with them are great, in case you do not want to rent a two-wheeler. Albeit a bit costly, but the transportation was very comfortable. A few names I remember are- Mr. Nitin and Ms. Maria at the front, Mr. Bapi in the café (y'all have to try the drinks he prepares, especially 'Green eye') and Mr. Arup, for whom I am incredibly thankful as he helped me a lot with my booking. Thank you much Zone connect, we'd surely recommend you guys wherever we go and we will definitely come stay with you again, whenever we come back!",5,November 2021

Amazing Hospitality,"Stayed at Azzure by Spree, North Goa for 04 nights from 26th Aug till 30th Aug 2019. It was an unforgettable experience as everything was perfect and exceeded our expectations.I feel, it’s one of the best and excellent property for hassle free stay in North Goa with excellent, luxurious and spacious rooms with 24*7 Room Service. Pick up &amp; drop facility also available with nominal charges.As a lady guests, they ensured our safety and offered us room upgrade to higher category. Everyone from entering till departure gave special attention on the requests &amp; made us feel more special.I would like to extend my special thanks to Ms. Baneshia (Front Office Manager) to accept our late checkout request &amp; her bunch of amazing, talented and cheerful team members including Housekeeping &amp; FnB members, who made each and everything possible to make our stay memorable from every aspect. I genuinely feel, their Hospitality brings a BIG Smile on the face of each &amp; every guest.Overall, I am extremely satisfied and happy with my choice of stay with “Azzure by Spree, North Goa”. Its highly recommend property to all those who are planning for a break and want to forget all worries and enjoy every bits and pieces.Will surely plan soon and come back for a longer duration to experience more.Keep Glowing Guys :) Wish you all the Luck &amp; success!Cheers",5,September 2019
Half good half horrible,"Stayed for 4 nights in room 405 &amp; 410 from 5-9th Jan 2020. First two days were pleasant stay, second two were horrible. Everyday got woken up to drilling sounds in the morning. Restaurant and service staff is good but senior management is hopeless. Horrible mell of sewage treatment plant in the block with room numbers 4xx, realised on 3rd day that it was because there is a sewage plant right adjacent to our rooms.Improper lighting in room, only two table lamps. Sunlight is available in ample but it gets hot with curtains off. Too many power cuts keeps there aircons roaring every time the electricity is back. Breakfast and room service is good. Club/indoor games room is under staffed and basic things like red bull are out of stock. Swimming pool is fine till there is scorching sunlight on top.Parking is available in ample, guards are awake and active 24x7.",2,January 2020
Superb stay,"We stayed at the Zone Connect Calangute for 6 days and were absolutely &amp; extremely happy with this gem of a hotel &amp; its courteous staff. Right from the reception to the rooms, everything is CLEAN and well kept. The property is definitely by far the best you can offer in a prime location yet tucked away in a small quiet by lane of Calangute. Their restaurant offers decent food as well. All in all an we had a fabulous stay and we cant wait to get back for our next family vacation. Value for money 10/10Room 10/10Property 10/10 (i feel when most of the times we as tourists are shuffling around Goa it makes perfect sense to go for this place compared to other options which have unnecessary perks like gym etc and then charge a premium)Restaurant 9/10 A special thanks to Divya, Jay, Maria, Hom, Arvind &amp; Harshwardhan along with the rest of their team to make sure that we had an AMAZING stay at Zone Connect Calangute.They say first impression is a last impression &amp; this made a perfect example :)Cant wait for our next stay with Zone Connect Calangute.",5,September 2023
Not open for Constructive Feedback,"Very bad behaviour and attitude of reception staff deputed.The staff was utterly confused regarding baby food and  and reception staff was not willing to take the feedback.They were not interested in taking feedback in a positive way , had multiple perceptions regarding baby food availability and charges .Please ask from them well in advance as they have not Put a notice at the reception that baby food is chargeable ,we have no issues paying for baby food and milk ,but the staff was not on the same page and some were saying it's free some have got the bills signed by us for baby food . Please be very clear with them when you are communicating as at the time of check out they will ask you to mention the name of the person who told you it's free .Have a sharp memory before you stay here .",1,March 2023
5 star service,"Tej and his crew provide us with the most amazing food and snacks we ate in the  whole goa trip . The food was mouth watering . Highly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich , white sauce pasta  , the meals here are value for money",5,November 2021
Comforting & Relaxed Stay at Zone Connect,"Staff is very courteous and greet you every point you meet them and best part is they all are eager to help you with everything whatever you request them.

Ms. Mariya, the receptionist always try helping you with all the information about Goa and shared contact details of taxi/ cab services available nearby. Overall we experienced a pleasant stay at Zone Connect. Rooms were big and there rooms for kids also attached to your room with a partition wall. So, good option for families to stay here.Pool part was additional fun point where you &amp; kids can enjoy swimming. I had a wonderful experience at Zone Connect…",5,July 2022
Good Property for a Pleasant stay,"Azzure hotel is located on just 1.50 km from Calangute beach and easily accessible from main roads. Good property for a pleasant stay with your family and friends.Good spacious rooms, Breakfast was excellent.They have clean swimming pools. Staff are very friendly.Things I didn't like  or need improvement are:1) Slow check-in process 2) Night Security guys were very adamant and rude 3) There are local taxi goons outside the hotel and they will not let you take any outside taxi. You will have to book a taxi thru them.",4,December 2019

Extremely bad stay,"This hotel is soo disturbing. Rooms are extremely small. Washrooms stink so much, everyday the housekeeping team knocks the door at 10am in the morning continuously. We were there for 6 days and complained about the housekeeping everyday but no change was made to it. Lot of noises coming from everywhere. No bells attached to rooms and they start beating up the doors early in the morning for checkout. Had the worst experience hereNot at all recommended to anyone who is here to stay and enjoy goa peacefully. Plus the receptionist is super rude and annoying!",1,December 2021
Over Friendly Staff and an amazing place to stay,Great Stay! I am Aditya Sodani from Kolkata and after a lot of research we decided to choose this property and now I think it is one of my best decision to stay. Best breakfast buffet I have ever came across along with beautiful rooms and washroom. Best location as it is very near to best beaches and near to Goa market in Calangute. We had a 7 day stay and staff were always on there toes to help us and even for lunch and dinner it is good option if you are not willing to step out. Maria and Nitin were too friendly and they made us felt so homely.,5,March 2022
Wedding anniversary,"I and my husband had stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was amazing. Right from the arrangement of all accommodation till the food all was super good.Infact on our anniversary day we had asked them to arrange for candle light dinner and room decoration Mr bapi who has done all these arrangements was outstanding   everything was just so perfect. Hands of to him. He deserves huge rounds of applauds. The hotel food is just finger licking, yummy   tasty and  their highly professional service towards customer has just left foot prints in our heart. Didn't wanted to go back from there , felt sad. Definitely whenever we visit goa its always going to be azure by spree for our accommodation. Thank you team so much.",5,November 2020
Average Stay compared to the high price,"More than 3kms away from calangute and candolim beach. We took a premium room but the rooms are extremely small only 257 sq ft compared to the high price they charged, also not well maintained. Water leakage from AC. Food is good.",3,August 2023

Zone in to here.,"Booked an executive suit for 8 days. The hotel location might not suit some as it was about a 7 - 10 minute walk into Calangute or 2 minutes in a Tuk Tuk for about 50 rupees, ( after a haggle). A Lovely room, well presented with great views of the pool and the farmland at the back of the hotel. Only downside was the size of the bathroom. This definitely needs upgrading. The bed was really comfortable, the air conditioning and fans were superb as it was very hot at times. The  stay itself was wonderful, the staff couldn`t do enough for you and the very impressive Maria on the front desk was a font of all knowledge.  The pool area was clean with pool towels on offer and lovely big comfortable sun beds. The restaurant food was very good and not over expensive. Overall a fabulous 8 day stay there. Thank you Maria and staff.",5,March 2024

Happy stay,"Frankly speaking I will give a 5 star rating to this place which gives best services to it's clients. Also, there is a common saying that the first point of contact holds a big reputation for it's organization.

So-so,"The service was terrible. They show a lot of amenities on their site, but everything is either broken or closed. The only thing good was the food. Also FYI, the cafeteria is open from 8 am to 10:30 pm. No food will be served after that. If you order from outside, you'll have to go to the gate to pick it up. They won't let the delivery guy come in or won't bring the food to you.",2,October 2021

"Excellent Location, Nice Property but Poor Maintenance","This is my visit to Kovalam. I stayed in this resort in the month of July 2013 for three days. I booked through cleartrip portal so i got the very good deal for my stay in this resort. One need to walk through the back door of the resort and it will take you to the Kovalam Beach just amazingly 200 Mtr from the resort. I got the sea view room so the views were awesome from my room. Since i visited this report in off season so the main pool was not opened. When i asked about this to management, i was told that it's under construction but there were not construction work going on. I would like to write my experience:Good: The property location is excellent. Resort is amazing. That's it.Bad: Maintenance of the resort is really very bad. There were lots of points to write about the same but i will not write in details because they have to improve the condition of every bit of the resort. Be it room, wash room, swimming pool, balcony of the sea facing room, white wash of rooms, garden... i mean everything. About Food:Food is of average quality and staff in restaurant need to know a word called ""service"" and ""customer satisfaction"". There are variable rates for food in restaurant for member and non-member of country club. I do not like this personally.There was also one incident when we wanted to have our dinner in restaurant but were told that we can not take the same. If we want to had dinner, we have to take buffet that is truly insulting. I mean how can any management insult there customers like this. I am sorry.I have visited so many resorts in various cities.... this was very disturbing experience for me. I will recommend this resort only for its location and proximity to kovalam beach.Visited in Juky 2013 with friends!",3,July 2013
Relaxing stay and Spa,"We decided to choose this resort because of membership we have and wanted to experience kerala spa with Beach access. This hotel is around 15 Km from Trivandrum and can be accessed by Taxi / Auto / Bus service from the city. The resort is very near to famous Ashoka beach but access to beach is not very friendly ( you have to walk through a kind of hilly area without good road or steps). The resort is known for good spa and we experienced it twice , it is an excellent kerala style spa where they use all herbal products ( we had full body massage). Breakfast and Dinner served at the resort was excellent and the restaurant staff are very cooperative and friendly Good about this resort :Very silent Near but not so near to town Good road access Friendly staff Very good food Good swimming poolAccess to beach Not so good :Not very well maintained rooms Some of the electrical switches were not working Bath room fittings are not maintained wellOne of the swimming pool is under maintenance and it looks like its like that from long time Verdict : Overall a very good experience , you will enjoy if you are expectations are limited to spa , beach and silence but not too much of luxury",4,October 2014
BED EXPIRIENCE,"hotel staff is not so good,average hotel,hotel is near beach but way is not good to reach beachand also swimming pool is under maintenance,studio room is under maintenance.we are group of 6 couples are visited in this hotel.",2,October 2014
Pathetic,"My worst experience during the last two days of my trip. The resort has dirty rooms with leaking A/cs, and cracks all over the wall. The Doctor in the Ayurvedic Spa was very rude and blunt. I actually cancelled a Ayurveda massage that I had booked . The staff in the reception are very rough when comes to dealing with customers. The complementary breakfast was cold,stiff and smelled as if it was prepared 5 days back.",1,April 2012
terrible,"When we reached there we were happy to see the location, but the rooms were dirty, toilet had urine stains, the housekeeping tried to remove it but was of no use. swimming pools were good , massage and restaurant  were  better , later when we came back from beach,  I found my new Reebok sandal missing from my room , I have registered a complained in their register  and till now I have not received them back nor any revert.",1,February 2012
Worst experience ever,"From Check in to Check out, it was a painful experience.1. The road leading to the resort is narrow infact a one way with lots of twists and turns, there are no sign boards or markers to guide. For someone who doesn't know the path, it is almost impossible to reach.2. Rooms are smelly, unhiegenic and  poorly maintained. once you checkin, first 2 hours will be spent in getting things fixed or corrected. Alternate rooms shown are also smelly. only option they have for this is turn on the Ac.3, The room service is too slow and poor. be prepared to eat cold food, cold tea when you order anything. you will have to check on it atleast 3-4 times.4. there is a small way to reach the beach from back side of hotel, which is poorly maintained and difficult to manouver. 5. once you checkin you will get a call from country vactions, to visit them and they will ask for your feedback, when you give them a poor feedback, instead of getting things corrected, they will try and sell you a membership.6. Food served in restaurant is poorly cooked, sometime you will feel it is stale and cold.All in all, if you are on vacation and have booked this resort as i did, be ready for a bad experience,",1,October 2013
disgusting experience in kerala which is otherwise truely God's own country..,"our stay in kerala from 14th to 24th march was one of the most memorable experiences as yet..except for our two nights stay in Country spa.the moment we reached the resort(?), we could sense the irresponsible behavior of its staff. we had to wait for nearly 45 mins to finally  get into a shabby room with a dirty bathroom.then when we asked for a jug of warm water, for 1 hour which we waited anxiously so as to quench the thirst of our 2 yrs old sick child.we ordered for 2 cups of tea  before dinner but that never arrived our room..as my child was vomitting so i could not feed her in the restaurant.so i requested the person attending there to pack 1 slice of bread., 1 idli and a boiled egg so that i could feed her in the room..1 st day he had no issue bt the 2nd day, with a disgusting gloomy face he replied that it was a complimentary breakfast so i could nt take the things to room....man... everywhere we had a ""Complimentary Breakfast"" and everybody very willingly help us to feed the baby.....this was the outcome of our refusal to take the membership of the club...right???cheap business.....the room cleaning and changing of bath linen everyday was also not done which are otherwise complimentary for the ""Great Country Spa"""".....my worst wishes are with u a so that you can recover from the grasp of cheap and inhuman business....",1,March 2012
*****PLEASE AVOID IT AL ALL COST*****,"A member of country club and had a terrible experience on my recent visit. The first room allotted was 306. It had a broken washbasin, the water faucets were rusted and looked unhygienic, live electric wires were hanging next to the shower and were exposed. Looked like a third class hotel which you can book for 500rs a night. The soap and shampoo provided were of the worst quality the soap smelt like crap. It was probable the cheapest in the market. there was no toilet paper and had to call 5 times before they could supply it. They said that they do not have earbuds when asked for it. The place is run by a bunch of disinterested employees who are doing their job for the heck of it, the kind of people that you find in a remote branch of government bank. The swimming pool had bird droppings floating on all 6 days that i stayed there. The sambar tasted like crap and the food was not at all up to the mark. I booked a cab to Kanyakumari from their travel desk. The executive convinced me to book it for the sunrise which meant that we had to get up at 3 AM and be ready by 4AM. When we reached the spot, it was clear the driver had slept and forgotten and made a story that there is a strike. It wasted our entire day. Later i booked a self drive car and went on my own only to realize that there was no strike. Highly unprofessional and unapologetic. The property itself is at a good location but it will spoil your trip as there is no maintenance everything is fixed with the makeshift items and nothing is fixed professionally making the property a piece of crap. You can book a 1000 times better property on the lighthouse beach at half the price. Even if you stay in a tent it would be much better than staying in this horrible place.",1,January 2017
Dont waste your time and money,"Management is so horrible..you will feel like they are doing favor on you by letting you stay in there Resort.Food was so gross because of it we decided to pack our food from outside,while reaching in resort we asked for plates they told us ,we cant give plates as you have not taken food from our resort..such a childish behavior..Manager  of Resort ""MR.VALU"" was such a arrogant,Rude and stubborn person, he will treat you like his subordinate rather then customer.PS:if u have planned for this resort, my free advise is to cancel it",1,August 2016
Needs Maintenance and proper management,"The resort was built with lot of attention to detail, but was maintained with attention to nothing.The access road to the resort is very small. The road from the resort to the beach is very poor and smelly.Resort restaurant is very good. Food quality and taste is good.Spa is also quite good. Massage is very relaxing, a must try at this resort.AC was working fine in the rooms so sleep quality was good.Swimming pool needs to be maintained properly.It will be a good stay if we go with very low expectations.",2,February 2015
No Security,"Celebrated ma wife's birthday, as well as a family get togetherMy Edifice edition watch &amp; my brother,s Ray ban glass was misplaced somewhereNo one showed any interest in helping us to find itCleaning staffs said they didn't even seen anythingHotel management said they wil check &amp; will inform usBut still no one didVery bad feeling, that we choose that place",1,August 2016
Country spa wellness it self in illness club,"If you are a Member so please visit it.And any body offer to make member of country club membership once you visit then buy.Pool, indor games, theater is not workingRestaurant food is not goodThey don't have privet beach.Beach is too far and way not properSo don't...",2,October 2015
COUNTRY SPA KOVALAM EXPERIENCE,"Our family  reached Country Spa Kovalam, We found it to be a huge Resort. The Road reaching to Resort was single lane and very narrow. My kids enjoyed swimming in the Swimming pool, and it was very near to Beach. It was a perfect Holiday with no pollution, no noise and relaxation. Spa was good and although Resort was far from tourist places and there was no visible shops nearby. Food was good, full of variety and spices.The building was under renovation in which we were staying. hence our room was getting dirty every time we came in or went out. Construction should be done in off season  Overall pleasant and nice experience",4,January 2014
Not Recommended,"I booked this Resort (4 Rooms) during last week of September 2012. I was told by RCI that this Resort was recently renovated and is receiving some excellent reviews. Definitely NOT!!!The Deluxe Apartments meant for RCI Members are situated at a pathetic location just 10 meters away from the entrance to the resort. The only view that you will get from your rooms are people coming in and going out of the resort. People expecting beach view since they claim this a Beach Resort will be in for a shocker to start with. They do not have anything for entertainment except for 1 Swimming Pool. Resort sponsored activities can be enjoyed only in dream in this resort.Partial Kitchen is just limited to a microwave oven and coffee maker. How do they expect the visitors to use them without a single cutlery? No Plates, Spoons, Glasses and utensils available. Upon multiple requests, they gave a few of them with great hesitancy. Air conditioning did not work in 2 of the 4 rooms that I booked. They could not repair it for almost a day and the second day, they repaired just one. We had to live without AC in one of our room for the whole holiday. Pathetic!!!Resort Staffs do not know the meaning of HOSPITALITY. None of them even have a smiling face to begin with… Their approach towards the visitors made me think are we here for charity or on paid vacation? Do I need to say more?",1,September 2012
Beautiful Budget Resort,"Country club is a well known group of clubs in India who specialize in holidays. You can either sign up as a member and enjoy yearly holiday packages or even stay as a one -off tourist. We booked Country Club Wellness Resort, Kovalam for a week last year. For starters, I can tell you that we had a really good time there!We were  booked in the regular room which can accommodate two children under the age of 12. The room is spacious enough for an extra bed and has a corner dedicated to in room dining. The cane furniture adds a cool rustic feeling to the decor. Bathroom is basic and we missed having a bathtub for a good soak. However, the amenities are adequately replenished and a water heater ensures hot and cold water supply. The resort is spread over a few acres. A beautiful landscape and the tropical weather of Kerela ensures a beautiful view from each room. The spa was our favorite hangout which gives a taste of the ancient science of wellness - Ayruveda to its residents. Massages, scrubs, internal and external body treatments are reasonably priced and the therapists are well trained. An in-house Ayurveda doctor advises you carefully on the regimen. The spa also has an aesthetic swimming pool complete with a life guard. There is only one restaurant in the resort and it does get  a bit boring to dine in two times a day if you are staying for a long time. We preferred In-room dining in evenings. However, the breakfast buffet is amazing and caters to Indian as well as international palette. Don't miss the breakfast!  Standard excursions, Airport drop and pick up can be booked with the concierge and they are always willing to help. Overall, a beautiful resort with great value for money.Check for the monsoon months for an off season price. July is peak of monsoons so remember to carry your umbrella!",4,July 2010
FEEL AT HOME,"I am a Country Vacation member. The experience was superb.Right from reception to room transfer, food to entertainment and checkout - all had some personal touch .The staff also arranged evening get together in a party hall area where other inmates will also join. There will be some game , some dance etc.. It is a very good drive. People got chance to interact with each other which is not possible in other hotel stay. The spa, swimming pool were also very good.The Kovalam beach is just at the rear side of the facility. But there is no proper way/path to go there. We need to go thru' trees / bushes and there is likelihood of falling too. Also we cannot go to the beach during evening/night hour as there is no proper way/lighting arangement. There should be proper walkway exclusively for Country vacations guests . Hope Management will think of this very much needed improvement.",5,February 2017
Quiet resort polite staff,Set back from the sea by a rocky rubbled path the resort could do with some upgrading. The staff are polite and cleanliness is a positive feature. We ate almost all our meals at the resort. Noticeably a few guests dipped their hands directly in the cereal or idli despite there being serving spoons which put us off the buffet breakfast. The massage centre pestered us when we were resting by phone calls or coming to the door which put us off using the massage. Front desk staff restaurant staff and cleaners were efficient making it a pleasant stay.,4,October 2016
Rude management and staff,Never visit this resort..PFB reasons.1.Very Narrow road while reaching to this property2.Had to wait for half an hour before getting the room.3.Response from restraunt manager is very poor.4.Worst food quality and quantity5.Wi Fi speed is slower then 2G6.NO towels and drinking water in rooms.Had to call in reception 5 times before getting it.Very bad experience.. please avoid visiting it..,1,August 2016
worst service from the staff. They are very rude. Never stay in this resort.,I had 2 days stay in Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort. My experience was very bad. The rooms are ok with some damages in the floor. The behavior of the staff is very bad. We ordered food from the restaurant. The quantity was not enough to fill even one persons stomach. They do not provide you with hot water for drinking even if you request them. The manager of the restaurant speaks in the manner as if he is doing a favor to you by providing you food or maybe he feels as he is giving it for free. There is no proper staff in the reception. Any random person who hardly understands Hindi or English is present in the reception. There is no one to attend you when you reach the hotel. Our check in time was 12:00 pm but we reached at 4:00 pm but still our rooms were not ready. Please think for a while before you visit this resort. And next main point whatever you see in the restaurant menu card is not available for lunch or dinner. Finally you have to order what they want you to have not what you wish to have. And the wifi speed is also very slow.,1,August 2016
Worst Stay ever,"The property is located near to beach and other near by places; however it is not well maintained. Unfortunate I am member of country vacation and will regret it whole life. They promised with studio apartment but always give me deluxe room that too with no facilities. Coming back to this property, first they gave me room on the under construction block. The room was messy with leakage all over, stinky and AC not working. After long fight and arguments they shifted me to other room. It was better but not good. Staff is least bother to their guests and literally ignore your request. If you ask them anything extra then it's like asking a big favour from them. It is a beach property and they expect you to use same towels for the entire stay.  We literally had to request multiple times to change bed linen and if you see their bed linen, it is smelly and looks like never washed. For anything or everything I had to complain to the manager. That's a different story that it never worked out well. The only good thing is their restaurant and restaurant staff. I went to see the customer relationship manager and took out all my anger thinking that he may do something, but realise that I wasted my time to explain him and writing a big email to him and country club customer care.",2,August 2015
Stay in Country Spa Kovalam,"We booked this hotel via Country Club. we stayed near the pool facing room. Our room was like a separate cottage, duplex type of house as we were 4 Adults+ 2 Kids. Rooms look good when viewed from outside like a show off but inside they are poorly maintained. The roofs inside the bathroom corners are rusted and sometimes leaking. The bathroom doors are not closing properly, so temporarily they have put some low quality locks for closing. There are 2 pools , one for kids and another for Adults, but the one for Adults always seems to be under maintenance. When we went also, there was no water in the Adult pool. The kid's pool is max, 3 feet deep.  One good thing is that my daughter enjoyed playing in the pool during the stay.When we went, there was some Electricity Power Problem as the main transformer got damaged due to some heavy wind and coconut trees fell on the transformer line. But they were trying to fix it. So, all 3 days during our stay, they were running generator to fulfill the power supply. At nights, there was no power for 2 hours and we were sweating. Food was horrible. Though there are many varieties in the food, but the taste is very very bad and most of the dishes are not cooked/ boiled properly.In the breakfast menu, there was no salt in the dosa, we can separate rice from dhaal in the pongal as the rice is nothing but the yesterday night's balance white rice from the buffet menu. this much poor quality coconut chutney I have never tasted anywhere.  The money you pay for food is not at all worthy. If you want to order food and have, everything seems to be on the higher side. A plate of chilly chicken is charged at Rs. 450 plus tax.The Road to the Hotel is very very narrow and only one vehicle could travel at a time. It was almost half km from main road to the hotel in that narrow road. At the back side of the hotel is the Ashoka beach but the path to the beach from hotel back side looks like going for a trekking journey.When we stayed they provided one extra bed as we requested but they did not charge for the same. For anything, we need to place a request like water, bathroom soap, etc. These were not placed by default during room cleaning. Overall, service is good but the Hotel needs to be maintained well and food is not tasty for the money they charge.",3,May 2014
COUNTRY CLUB HAS TO IMPROVE  & MAINTAIN THE QUALITY.,"We &amp; our friends stayed in Country Club Kovalam in  the month of Jan 13.  for three days. Nice place, not maintained well, food is bad &amp; restaurant is not clean. We had bad experience on the first day, the room was full of bugs.To the beach their don't have a proper road. Need to improve a lot.",2,January 2013
Complete waste of a nice location,"As a part of our Kerala trip, we stayed in this hotel. From the pictures, it seemed a great place to be but we were very disappointed.Locaiton: The hotel is located near one of the most popular beaches, Ashok beach. But don't be misguided as some reviews say, it's a ""private beach"". It's not a private beach. It's completely public crowded beach. It takes around 200-300m walk to reach the beach. The path is not well maintained either. It stinks and dirty. Because of that you can't visit the beach in the night even if you want to. The rooms aren't well maintained either. The look very old and in need of maintenance. While checking out, I even heard some guests complaining about bugs/cockroaches found in their room.The nearby property, KTDC Samudra, is much better managed than this. Service: This was probably the worst part of the stay. The room we were provided was stinking until they had to use air freshener. The hot water wasn't coming in the bathroom. The housekeeping came and kept repairing for an hour, when we were wasting our time there just waiting. After which he told us that we'd have to shift the room. The new room had the same stinking. After some time, the A/C started leaking in the new room. The shower wasn't working well and in spite of requests, it was never fixed until we left. Overall, killed our experience.Food: We opted for MAP plan (includes breakfast and dinner). From the looks of it, the buffet had variety, but overall the food was not satisfying at all. If there is one good item, rest assured, it'd be empty at the table. Most of the standard food like corn flakes, were of below par quality. Overall, during our stay one of their representatives was asking us to opt for Country Club membership. After such a poor service, I doubt anyone would go for the membership.",2,January 2013
Please don't go....!,"It was our last 2 days stay of honeymoon trip in Country Spa. The first thing we saw after entering to room was cockroaches...! Terrible...!No phone connectivity... TV was not working...! No towels in the room...!Everytime we had to run to the reception for assistance. We purchased some fruits from local market and what we requested was 'An empty plate'... The restaurant manager told, ""We provide plates only with the food..!' Worst experience at the end of our honeymoon trip.",2,December 2012
Lovely roooms,"During My way to this hotel, I was concerned as road was very much raw and narrow. It was very much inside from main road but once i reached to my room. I forgot rest of the things and was happy with the arrangement. They have good restaurant and very beautiful view of kovalam beach. I recommend this hotels.",4,June 2011
Relaxing Holiday,"My family has Country Club membership and we are from Mangalore, Karnataka. After taking membership we decided to try it out and decided to visit their Kerala property. We decided to go to their Kovalam resort as it was near to our hometown and also offered good Auyrvedic therapies.  We called their RMC department and got our booking confirmed and told them specifically that we are going there for relaxing and asked them to make necessary arrangements. When we reached the property, we were welcomed with smiley faces and were checked-in immediately. The property is located close to Kovalam beach amidst complete greenery and has very serene settings. Room that was allotted to our family was spacious, cleanly kept and had good facilities. The air-conditioning was working fine and we had 24 hours hot water in the bathroom.  There was microwave as well but we did not use it. But I feel they need to improve on the room service. It took them about average time of 10 minutes to turn-around. Also, even in the restaurant, it was little bit delayed but not as much as the rooms.This property is bit away from the beach and I suggest asking the hotel staff for directions and best of locations and the road to be taken before you venture out. They had a travel desk which arranged for our local sightseeing and bit of shopping also. The Ayurvedic centre is very good here. We enjoyed many types of therapies, massages and the best was something they called hydro-therapy or a floating spa. This gives very good relaxation for the entire body. For us, they prepared some Ayuverdic dishes also. The instructors and the Ayurvedic physicians are very good at their job. They asked lot of questions about our lifestyle and calculated the best of therapies that were necessary for us and guided us accordingly. Our stay was very good and at the end of the holiday, we came home very relaxed.",5,September 2011

Good location but low maintenance,"Country Spa Wellness resort is at a very good location and good property. However the facility and rooms are not maintained well. They can improve and take advantage of location. Ashoka beach is just behind, like the hotel is in the hill top and you can get down 200m to the beach.",3,September 2017
Poorly maintained and unclean rooms and pool,"We have ifetime membership in country club. For booking they asked us to pay for breakfast in advance to block the rooms! 'Perks of being a life time member' maybe. When we checked the online price for the rooms it was almost close to what we had to pay for breakfast for 2 pax. We checked in and they took us to our rooms. Smelly, unclean poorly maintained interiors &amp; water was staging inside the bathroom. Checked out immediately. Went to see the swimming pools, one was under maintainence and the other was in poor condition.",2,July 2017
Not so good,The property is very near to the so called beach.. the beach is not like beaches in goa where you can play or relax. Its very small beach and nothing much u can do there other than sit and watch the high waves. there are couple of restaurants near the beaches with good view. The resort is not maintained properly. the rooms are not up to the mark. most of the stuff is either broken or not working. Restaurant on the other hand is nice and staff in the restaurant are great. There is indoor games room but it was closed due to some reason and we could not play anything for our 3 days stay. Main swimming pool was under maintenance and there is second swimming pool which is small. SPA prices are on the higher side.overall would not recommend to stay there if you have other options.,3,July 2016
Excellent Property & Friendly Staff,"staff,spa,food &amp; Travel desk  all are excellent and rooms were neat and cleaned planning to visit again in the season time,they said its very hard to get booking in the season time if it is not booked before",5,June 2015
Good Property With Spacious Family Rooms,"I have booked two property near KOVALAM beach, One if it was Country Spa Wellness Kovalam,I booked it through Hyderabad branch with a priority support from Mr.Wasim (Booking Support) which made our booking so easy and i recommend this for a family stay with big rooms with clean and best amenities.Its property campus is big with security for kids to play around and a big swimming pool for kids, access to the beach is at walk able distance.",4,May 2014
Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort,We stayed in Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort for 3 nights and our stay was ok.Though this resort is located near the beach the access road to beach is not very great.This resort is located near to major attractions like Poovar back water and Trivandrum.resort quality is average and interior &amp; exterior work was going on when we visited the resort this spoils the quality of resort.Barring few helpful employees the resort is not helpful for the tourists.,3,December 2013
nothing to appreciate,"We have visited these hotel in march first week, superior room is offered to us, but note that here isuperior just better than standard and below delux. so dont think you are getting best in the hotel. resort is near by beach. but you have to travel by very narrow street to reach at hotel. Ala- karte option is available unlike the other hotel in kerala( usually offering buffet). AC and fan was making noise and not rectified  even after reported twice. ambiance, food, location ..there is nothing to appreciate....its not bad but not upto the mark fulfill the expectation. they can improve at least by updating old amenities.",2,March 2014
Nice Rooms but remote location,Good if you are having a vehicle of your own.Few Good points:1. Rooms (I stayed in a beach view room)2. Friendly staffThings to work upon:1. Activities in the resort2. Road to beach3. Doctor on call4. Food taste.5. No directions for the first time visitor on the road towards the resort.I would say my satisfaction ratio: 4/10,2,March 2014
Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort,"JetPrivilege membership: 134250782Reached the hotel on 26th Oct'13.The road leading to the hotel is very narrow, you cannot find the hotel if you are on your own.Hotel location is very close to Kovalam beach.With in 5 minutes you are on the uncrowded part of Kovalam beach.Hotel property is well maintained and the rooms are neat and clean.I would not give high marks to housekeeping.Breakfast and lunch spread is good.",3,October 2013
most horrible stay ever.,"I feel sad to say this. But yes..it was..There was no sign on road leading to the hotel and most difficult was to find the location. And as you find the road be ready to get stuck in the way, its a one way!Rooms were damp and smelly. Bed sheets and covers were unclean. Room service too costly. Its not at all a beach resort. its about 200 meters away and on the path you can meet various insects and reptiles!Utterly Sad!",1,September 2013
Beach Property with namesake access to beach,The  property is located after a nerve racking one km long winding lane where not meeting an accident is guaranteed.Small property -no great shakes in maintenance&gt;restaurants leak &gt; food is terribleRooms/Cottages are ok but poorly maintained.Swimming pool was not working when we went thereNever to be repeated experience although its still better than Country Club De Goa,3,September 2013
"Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort, Kovalam",It was a great experience in Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort for two days in the 2nd week of January this year. Kids really enjoyed the stay. The location is just a wakable distance from the beach from the back door of the resort. Resort Management may look into laying a proper path way/road to reach the beach with some lights etc. to make it feel more safer in the night. Staff are polite and friendly. Though they are maintaining it well there is still lot of scope to improve it and to take it to an international standards.,4,January 2013
Could be better,"We were given this on an RCI exchange so it was free for us.  the reviews are probably justified but it would take very little for them to make this a lot better. First the management at the front desk were very helpful, and I cannot fault them.  They changed our first room when we asked (it overlooked the restaurant and smelt), the second was much nicer. But I have to say the toilet didn't look it was cleaned and the sink was cracked badly.  And there was almost never hot water in the shower. The air conditioning was incredibly noisy but they did improve that a bit for us. And there are no partial kitchen facilities at all - but we did have a fridge.  But no kettle. And attempts to get hot water just failed most days. Our telephone didn't work ever.  The towels smelt (we think from the spa) but they did change them when asked.  The spa treatments were good - but my second one was ruined by the massuese being interuppted (by a boyfriend?) at the door about 10 plus times.  The location was off the beaten track - you had to take a tuk tuk - but this was not difficult or expensive and we quite liked the chance to see the back streets.  The restaurant was poky and unattractive so we avoided that - that's a definite area for improvement.  And no bar.  Just a little extra spent on this place would bring it up to scratch.  We were well warned by the reviews so took an ""exotic Marigold"" approach - Staff were great and that made a huge difference.",2,December 2012
Bad Experience,"Hotel rooms were very uncomfirtable, bed sheets very yellow. lobby for smelly. Requested for a change in room and the alternate offered after one hour was even worse so have to stay with previous one as no choise. Staff is very unfriendly and rude. I don't recomend this   hotel to my fellow travellers. Location is also not very good as you have to go through small one way roads to reach hotel.",2,December 2012
Very tired and shabby looking,"I booked a superior room at the Country Spa hotel – which looked very shabby. The bathroom was old fashioned with dirty grouting. Attention was drawn to the fact that I had a beach view room. I suppose I could see the sea in the distance but before this, all I could see was a corrugated iron roof of the rooms below, barbed wire and rubbish. And the room was in the same block as the kitchens – with all the accompanying smells and noise – starting at 5 am. I had one meal in the restaurant – disgusting food with filthy table cloths in a very stuffy room. The reception staff are very friendly but they are working with very limited resources. If you walk down to the beach watch out for the very uneven surface and the cow pats!  It’s better to order an auto-rickshaw from reception to go to Lighthouse beach where there are plenty of bars, restaurants and shops. I’m sure there must be better hotels in Kovalam at non-luxury prices.",2,December 2011
HORRIBLE SERVICE & FOOD,"We stayed there for 2days &amp; 2nights. The service provided was awful. In fact, they don't have much to say as they are not offering much. Firstly, there was no hot water, then the washroom tap wasn't working, the bedsheets were not clean and had stains.It was pretty disgusting u know. The restaurants' utensils were not hygienic as it was not washed properly. The food was pricey but was not good at all. Later, at the room, we called room service to bring us some boiling water to make a hot drink. The server from the restaurant brought cold water. I really don't understand these people at the reception as well as they seem to ignore our problems when we complained. Terrible! That was our first and last stay at this place. Not again!",1,February 2011
Nice Spa resort,"Hi, I was accompanied by my spouse and 1 kid. Got a studio room facing the swimming pool. Nice compact resort. Resort has a swimming pool and Ayurvedic Spa with Jacoozi too. Room was spacious and clean with good asthetic look furniture. Room service and staff with excellent hospitality. Very close to Kovalam, Ashoka beach maybe 10 mins walk. Not too far from Trivandrum airport too. Food quality was good especially Kerala authentoc food.",4,April 2010
Pathetic place to stay,"I booked my stay with Country Spa and Wellness Resort Kovalam for 3 days 2 nights, and my stay has been a painful experience.Today morning (after my 1st night of stay) I woke up to find there was no water in both rooms we had booked. After multiple follow ups the person in reception reluctantly checked to find the motor pump was not switched on. Once the motor was switched on, we were asked to wait for 15 mins, which took almost 3 hours for the us to get the water. When asked, we were told there is blockage in the pipe. I spoke to the manager (Mr. Arun) who arranged for another room, for us to use the bathroom on urgent basis, which was filthy and worse than a public toilet. We asked the reception person to check and address the problem and ensure this does not happen again. And guess what at not even 24 hours have gone, there is no water In our bathroom. Such irresponsible people that they don't even care to switch on the motor pump in time. I had to run behind to get the water in our bathrooms.I've tried reaching Mr Arun a number of times. He neither picks up the phone nor does he care to ring back to check if his guests are facing any problems. Pathetic customer service!!!",1,June 2019
Good Resort,"Country Spa Kovalam is very good location.  Rooms are good and staffs are very co-operative, Evening activities they are conducting ie very good. Food was very tasty and variety of food also they are serving.",4,December 2017
Like it,"I am a member of Country Club and stayed here for three nights. It's a good resort with all amenities like swimming pool, kid's play area etc.But the best thing is the behaviour &amp; attitude of the staff. We were first given a room which is quite good with attached living room, but no sea view. Upon a simple request to the front desk ,they allotted the me the best sea view room. Quite big,clean linens, proper cleaning of room &amp; wash room everyday. Very good room service with smiling face. We didn't prebook the food and enjoyed a la carte. Good food with sufficient variety at reasonable prices. No complains. Beach is 100-150 meter away but no proper road which needs to be addressed.We checked out late at about 3 pm instead of 12 noon. No question raised by the management. Transparent billing. Very satisfactory stay. Like to go again.Thanks, Country Club.",4,February 2017
Good for stay,This is very good beach resort  for staying with family and well maintained also good human being well mannered staff non polluted atmosphere  overall all are positive very closed to beach and last but not least value for money thanks to all staff members,5,December 2016
It's a nice resort to spend Leisure Time,"The Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort is located at Ashoka Beach, Kovalam, Thiruvananthapuram, India.  The Resort Services such as Restaurant, House Keeping, Pool and SPA are seems to be good.Office Management and Billing Systems are very good.Way (About 1 KM) to the Resort is little Narrow, but most of the Resorts in Kovalam, Kerala are like that.Better to choose this resort in Winter Season.",3,April 2016
Bad rooms and the food is worst,the property si not maintained. i am a country club member so anyways i have been cheated and now the self property si horrible. the location is not on beach since many small resort with less price have beach facing rooms. food is horrible with palm oil. we only ordered biryani and the oil was bad . there are hotels nearby like curry leaf and sanjeevani so please do not eat here. the service is not much. Spa closed at 40m so no use and small trainee staff for the same. no view from room and less light post 6pm . carry torch if you are planning to go on beach  post 5 to see sun set. the hotel back road is very narrow.so be careful.form 1 year pool is under maintenance- the staff dont want to work only it seems.,1,February 2016
Paid Nightmare,"This is absolutely horrible. Reception area was full of smoke, apparently to repel mosquitoes. No one around except for reception boy. Room simply horrible. Shower is vertically on top of toilet. No shower curtains. Walls filthy, linen torn, furniture dirty and worn out, all one can see from window or balcony is filth. Lizards hanging on curtains. Beach at a fair distance connected by a dingy mud path through forest. Food deals are forced on you and food is totally substandard. No staff around to even come to room for on the spot assessment.Had booked 2 nights, could somehow hang on for one night before checking out first thing in morning, without any refund. Simply the worst room I have stayed in during my life.",1,January 2016
this is worst property to stay,"The room was not maintain properly.ther is no amenitis in room Tovels,beedsheet ,are so worst that you cant sleep well on bed .pls do not give this hotel too any one as i am alreday member of country club but i do not see this type of property any where. West of my money and time.",1,November 2014
"No proper approach road,Poor maintenance","Initially we had problems in finding the resort as the approach road was too narrow. On arrival though we were provided a room quickly, the irony was that the AC did not function.There were no other rooms available in the same category on that night as per the manager so we had to manage with open windows and a noisy fan.We were allotted another room the next day in a higher category though as I persuaded them to change my room.The swimming pool was non functional.The cleanliness of the room was average however the resort was poorly maintained with construction debris all over the place.The spa was the most horrible experience we had as the people were completely non professional and discourteous.The only best part was the access to quiet Ashoka Beach through the rear gate which made it easy for us to go to the beach as and when felt.",2,August 2014
Good experience at country spa,"Location is good, close to the beach, had initial difficulty in accessing as the phones lines were not accessible/updated.Rooms are spacious, interior we'll done. Toilets need frequent renovation to maintain to the standards of country club. Lawns are maintained.Even though electricity is a problem in hoe region, genet availability throughout was a great relief.Did not try out other facilities.",4,May 2014
Worst maintained resort of country club,"We(Me&amp;my wife) went to this country club property on a weekend vacation to Kovalam. We had a terrible experience from check in till check out in this property. We have booked it for 2 night and 3 days but left Kovalm in just one night stay. 1&gt; Beware, here check in start at 2PM and check out at 12Noon. We rechd here around 10 AM after a long ride from Bangalore. To Add to our misery we have got a stinky room of a under construction building. It was above the restaurant. AC was not working bathroom is stinking, room is small, it was impossible for to stand there.  2&gt; After a big complaint and few angry expressions of mine they agreed to shift us to a new room but after 2PM as the check in start at that time. Second room offered is also not good but definitely better than the prev one. And by that time we lost any expectation from this pitty resort and agreed to stay there. 3&gt; Lunch served here is ala-carte basis they say you can order anything any amount. But when we order our chosen items from the menu waiter simply with a smile said 4 out of 6 items are currently not available for order. Then we have left no choice then to accept what is available with them at that time. we went at around 1 PM for lunch.4&gt; If you look at Resort out look land capes its not a bad resort but it is so badly maintained you will never like anything. 5&gt; there is 2 swimming pools but only children pool is operational other pool they dont keep even a drop of water.6&gt; Here also country vacation guys will hunt you to trap you in another scheme. Never do a mistake of taking country vacation membership. we are regretting.7&gt; After this experience we didnt have guts to visit their spa center for which this resort is build.6&gt; Last but not the least there is not many places you will like to visit in kovalam. Dont expect even a 10% of enjoyment of what you can get in Goa.We ruined our holiday... it was not a holiday it were some terrible days.",1,April 2014
Expect not much,"We booked this property through RCI and were disappointed once we entered the room.To reach the property you have to drive through a lane where only one vehicle could pass. I am still wondering what they would do in case of emergency to get ambulance.The unit has a partial kitchen but no shops nearby to buy anything. The bathroom beams and ceiling need painting and hence present an ugly appearance. The tiled walls need cleaning and touch up. For an RCI resort, the bathroom is a bit small. The closet (the toilet) bowl needs to be changed to more modern and clean one.The housekeeping was too slow to respond to phone calls. The towels and pillow covers need to be replaced with better stuff.The prices mentioned in the room service menu were on the higher side.The plus point is the natural environment and the proximity to the Masjid Beach of Kovalam. This beach is behind the resort but one has to walk through some other property. The path is topsy turvy and can be tried only when there is sufficient sunlight.They have a travel department that organizes tours. The young at the reception were very cooperative and try to help you with all the information. The helpful staff made the stay tolerable.",3,March 2014
Ok Ok Resort,"I stayed in this resort in Sep 2013 (2N, 3D) during the Onam holidays. Overall the resort is OKAY.. not upto Country Club Standard. The reception ceiling itself was damaged and leaking. Its high time these are repaired as the first impression is the last impression. Beach is not nearby, there is muddy way to beach.. which is not the resort property.. so route is all dirty. Talking about the room - 611, we were told that we are given a Superior room, the room had a broken may be 10yrs old AC. It was running like a generator. Again leaking roof found in the room. Bathroom was okay but had cobweb and small bee hives in the AC went in the bathroom. Blanket torn, towels torn and old, threads coming out. I think its been ages somebody cleaned the rooms and did some renovation. The corridor too room smelled pathetic, walls had fungus and smelled bad. Room had a small fridge, the trays had rust on it. ROOM Rating: 1.5/5Facility: No entertainment in the resort. We were told there are two swimming pools and one was under maintenance, the other one was so dirty that anyone would hardly think of swimming. No maintenance at all. Photos showed they had TT table, when I checked the room was not setup and was under renovation. I read some comment from others as well that there was some renovation going on but how long?? No wifi in rooms, everything shown in site is lie. FACILITY Rating: 1/5Breakfast was okay the first day. Second days three items went missing (No Chicken, French toast etc) and didn't even got a chance to taste Baked beans. Breakfast timing is 730 AM to 10.30 AM, 9 AM baked beans over.. but no change in rate 200 Rs per person. Dinner - First day had only option of Buffet Dinner - 330 Per head, with only 1 Chicken, 1 Fish and 1 Egg dish. Kulcha was half cooked. The spread was not worth 330 Rs. Next day we thought of going for Ala carte, (Pls don't think of opting this one, turned out damn expensive and still hungry). Food quality 1 star but price was that of 5 Star. 2 Chapatti - 43 Rs, 3 Phulka - 43 Rs, 1 Paratha - 43 Rs, 1 Kerala Parota, no difference in rate. Malabar Fish Fry - King fish marinated in Malabar masala and shallow fried - We got fish deep fried with Besan covering, like Fish Pakoda. Ordered Chicken Fry, the masala on top was not cooked and was raw and sticky, I complained and had to argue with the guy in the restaurant and return it. He told that he will get it replaced without charge and give us Tawa fried fish, small pieces for Rs 427 was charged again, I gave up and I dint wanted to get into further argument. Food Rating: 0.5/5Housekeeping: We requested for change of bedsheets and towels as had our legs itching after using the blanket the first night. Towels torn, blankets torn. Housekeeping took 2 hrs to change but they were well behaved.Housekeeping Rating: 2.5/5Please carry your own entertainment stuff/ games etc or else you will be bored to death here.",2,September 2013
"Nice property, excellent location","the best thing about this resort is its location, just walk down to the back side of the resort and you can move into sea beach, if you love walking you can keep your pace and enter the local market nearby. If you take a cab you have to drive through many by lanes but if you walk by from behind its hardly a 1 mile distance, and a very pleasant walk.the hotel property was nicely kept, food was good.",4,August 2012
best resort in kerala,"i stayed for 2 nights, when i entere in to resort feel like some eco-resort nice ambiance, nice swimming pool, well maintained land scape.  excellent staff, so I thought "" this one is not like the other Country club hotels, it's good"",), the room was excellent!!!(Kudos team housekeeping) and their housekeeping services was prompt and delicate. Pick up from airport- excellent Reception - excellent Housekeeping- excellent Restaurant- pathetic Room service- pathetic As a leader a good boss leads by example by coming to work on time, doing the job well",5,July 2012
Kovalam Visit for Honeymoon.,"Recently I visited Kovalam(1st week of Feb.) for my honeymoon and stayed at Country Club Spa and Resort.The tour was gifted to me by me Elder sister who is a member of the country club group.Overall I had a good experience but definitely some important things were lacking which should be present at any good resort.My room was Superior Deluxe which didn't have a bath tub in the bathroom and the first disappontment was I had to ASK for the bucket and jug but they were expected to be already present in the bathroom.House keeping staff was punctual and regular, no doubt, but were inefficient as cleaning of room was very superficial and gross.AC was good but its remote was not working and setting of temp.was not possible so we had to run it at a preset temp. and this posed a problem because sometimes you need to change the temp.The food quality was good and room service was also good but the cost of certain food items were out of proportion.The most negative point I felt was its location.It is located in suc interiors that you cant go to the nearby market easily.Due to such location, you become totaly dependent on the resort's resturant.So you are cofined to eat what is available in the resturant or you have to go some 1.5 to 2 kms for the needful.Also the resort should have a small shop for general items of daily items.Overall average experience.",3,February 2013
Tim and maggie,"Just had 2weeks at country spa Kovalam. What a great vacation, staff were friendly and helpful and the resort overall was good. Beach 2minutes walk with great local beach restaurant but buy a flashlight, very cheap, you will need it. Would we go back? Yes had a fabulous time.",4,January 2013
The perfect one,"We stayed at Country Club, Kovalam in January 2013. The Resort is located very near to the sea beach (Just 2 minutes walk) We stayed at Duplex cottage for 5 nights and we found the place a great value. Rooms were neat, clean and hygienic and so were the washrooms. Swimming pool was always sparkling clean. Very nice buffet food. And surprise was the Spa with experienced staff.Dr. Sibi the resort manager is epitome of hospitality industry with vast knowledge and experience and helpful nature.They have a very helpful travel counter.",5,January 2013
C.R.Jayaprakash  Nice vacation,"We stayed one week on country vacation membership. Resort is small and nice. a stone throw distance from Asoka beach , well maintained, food package was very reasonable and with good menu. Rooms moderately good with sufficient amenities. travel desk is very helpful in arranging sight seeing .over all it was a nice stay in the resort.",4,January 2013
Value for money,"We stayed for 3 nights in the resort during December.The stay was plaesant ,room was clean and had good aesthetic furniture.Food was also moderately priced and good.The main attraction was that the secluded patch of Kovalam beach called Ashoka beach was only a stones throw from the backside of the resort and was least crowded unlike the main Howah beach in Kovalam.We used it like a private beach.The two swimming were well maintained and good.Most importantly we checked some other hotels and tariff in two hotels in Kovalam,the two other hotels with lesser facilities were charging almost double of what this hotel was charging us.@ 3000/night it was quite reasonable during the period.We recomend it as a good 3 star hotel in Kovalam",4,January 2013
STAY AWAY,"As a member of RCI for many years and having experienced RCI affiliated resorts in India and abroad, this one was such a let down. The location of the property was so poor and it started with absolutely no signages on the entire way from the airport and if we had not hired the car from the resort we would have had a hard time finding the same.The beach they say is 5 mins away. Yes that is true, if you want to reach the same you have to chance a broken ankle or something, such is the way to the beach with steep climb up and down and ZERO lights.The condition of the rooms was so poor and ill maintained with threadbare towels, rough, yellow and seemingly unwashed bed sheets. They were not even changed for the 4 days that we were there. The light fixtures and the furniture fitting which were borken were not even replaced. The staff has no concept of housekeeping and the same was done at 8pm in the night one day and that also on our returning from a whole day excursion.As for the restaurant we made a mistake of eating on day one, with uncleaned tables, unfilled food trays, no glasses for water unless reminded, cold food etc, etc. it was a bad experienceAll in all look for other options .............",1,December 2012
Pathetic!!,"The hotel/resort/crappy place from the very beginning was terrible.  As soon as you enter the place feels old and dirty and in need of a lot of maintenance.  There is absolutely no house keeping sense among the staff.  Housekeeping is done only after repetitive requests and then too the level of cleanliness is just not upto the mark.  The first day we had lunch at the place which absolutely a horrible experience right from the uncleared tables, dirty table clothes, empty trays of food, lack of serving spoons,etc etc.  Oh yes in addition to all this the road leading from the resort to the beach was so bad without any lights or any kind of directions.  Luckily we found a nice beach shack tucked in on the way to the beach which saved us atleast when it came to meals.  Overall it was a very bad experience especially after knowing that such a place is affiliated with RCI since the RCI resorts like club Mahindra are just a class apart.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless I want to torture the person.",1,December 2012
Romantic getaway,"My husband and I visited Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort, Kovalam from 17th to 20th August 2012. We had made reservations in advance and had requested for a beach facing room. As promised, we got a great view of the beach. The room had an old world charm about it, with wicker and old wood furniture. It just added to the ambience of the stay. The room was clean and all the necessary amenities were available. The resort is literally a stone's throw from the beach. So you can just go for a stroll as and when you please. We went for a swim in the pool at the resort. It was clean and well maintained. The food at the resort was decent. The staff at the reception desk is very friendly and helpful. When we inquired about ways to move around the place and places to visit, they were good enough to arrange for a cab or a rickshaw with a trustworthy driver to take us sight seeing and shopping. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to visit the ayurveda centre. Overall, the stay was lovely and I'm looking forward to visiting again, this time for a longer stay so that I can really enjoy the resort.",4,August 2012
Not good experience,We stayed here for 2 nights here. Hotel rooms are old and not clean. Service is not good. Staff is very less and the can't manage multiple requests at time. Though check in time is 12 noon we reached there at 2 PM still they have not cleaned our rooms. There was one extra bed in my room and the take more than 1 hour to take away after my request. I have to call them 2 - 4 times to do it. We have to wait for 30 mins out side because room was not clean even it's 2 pm and we had advance booking for our room. I will not prefer this hotel for couples or family.,2,November 2012
A wellness centre it is not! I'd rather sleep in a tent!,"This was the worst place i have ever stayed in!  From the minute we arrived at the gates with their pealing paint, I thought things were not looking good.  We had been used to a week of being greeted by refreshing drinks, garlands and hot flannels.  Here we were greeted by a man who stared at us as he peered at our passports, it only got worse!  We were taken to our accomodation which had a musty smell as soon as we walked in, the bathroom was disgusting with mould in the grouting, nearly  everything was old battered and shabby, nothing was well maintained, the kitchen units as well as the bathroom needed pulling out and starting again! The fan looked as if it was about to fall off the cealing.  We asked to move and to be fair they did offer us two rooms in a different part, all be it with a view towards the sea which included a barbed wire fence around the property!.  This second property had a treck of many stairs to reach it, also there was a filthy door which I think lead into the retaurant kitchen!  We therefore declined the second offer and stuck with the first one purely because we were awaiting the arrival of a family member that evening, otherwise i would have been gone like a shot.  We then tried to settle in to accomodation no1, to discover there was dust on the floor including hair, we asked for someone to clean it, they sent a young lad with a big mop, no bucket to rinse with!  My husband asked that he used a dustpan and brush first, poor little fellow came back with a dustpan but no brush, he had to use his fingers to pick up the dirt!!  A little later to my absolute horror I discovered long black hairs aroud the outside of the toilet bowl   these did not belong to any member of my family!  Once again the same little lad was called to clean the place, he removed them and cleaned around with his bare hands and a cloth, no gloves to protect him, nothing, how disgusting.  Later we went to the restaurant, another filthy place where the tablecloths hadn't been changed, the furniture was grubby and I'm sorry to say the buffet food was dried up and unappealing, once again it scored on being the worst Indian meal.I had to sleep in that dirty place that night, I would have rather slept in a tent under the stars.Next day with the arrival of another member of our party we were moved again, this time into two cottages, this was marginally better, despite the cockroach on the floor, and to be absolutely fair the staff did their best to keep these cottages clean and provided us with clean bedsheets and towels daily for the rest of our stay. The staff also did their best to keep the cottages as clean as they could, we did return one evening to a broken window and they were going to move us again but with persuasion the problem was resolved.  The swimming area was OK but there was only one lounger.  This is a place that was perhaps very nice once, but it s terribly run down and needs a complete revamp to breathe new life into it.  I have no idea who owns it but it would appear he just doesn't care, or maybe the group timeshare owners don't have any money!!  If you are used to western or decent standards do not stay here.",1,September 2012

Feel calm & Wellness beside the magmanimity of roaring sea,"We have got the booking of this beautiful hotel throgh our Kerala-Lakshadweep tour operator M/s ITTO.The design &amp; lay out of the hotel which was situated very close to Ashoka beach was very attractive and mind boggling. The pool location and the cleanliness of the pool and its associated faciiities were marvellous. The girl/boy at the reception were aptly hospitable with a welcome smile in the face. The hotel boy who guided us to our room was very informative and sobre.The room originally allotted to us changed by the persons at the reception at our request to make us feel more comfortable. the room finally allotted to us was adequate space and fitting furnitures with pleasant colors. The neat &amp; cleanliness of the room was eye-catching. The space availability of restaurant  though small but the services provided was prompt  and delighting. The quality &amp; qualtity of food were very good, especially the desserts are really tantallising.We can not forget the evening we spent beside the swimming pool after the dinner with the calm and quietness of the surrounding.We were so enthralled with our stay at this hotel that we had to request our tour operator to book us for one more day stay there up on cancellation of our booking at some hotel at Allepey.",4,January 2011
A Nice Place at Kovalam,We truly enjoyed our annual holiday at Country Club Kovalam. It was really nice holiday considering that we were a large group and the resort manager and the entire staff made it a point to make us feel awesome. This resort is on the Kovalam beach area with sort of a private beach at the backyard. Rooms were very spacious with most of the facilities and the highlight of the resort is the Ayurvedic Spa. They have one of the best Spa facilities in the area and what we all enjoyed most was the ‘floating spa’ meant for Hydrotherapy. The swimming pool was large and clean. Food was good and over all ambiences is really nice.,4,February 2011
Worst food I ever had in the resort,"I stayed in this property in October, 2010. If you coming in the night then the way to the property looks like a haunted place, staff is not at all trained, they have kept management trainees at a cheap salary, who are just learning on the guest, don’t expect too much of courtesy from the staff in the property.The food is really not upto the mark, rooms are really small, if you get food from outside the resort charges Rs. 50/- just for the plates, as per them the profits comes out of food what guest eats.If you planning to go to any near super market, you have to walk for 1.5 km, the property doesn’t offer too much of indoor / outdoor activities for any age.My overall experience in the property was just average, my observation among other guest who were staying at the resort seems to be not happy with the resort and with the staff.",3,October 2010
"Feel good resort, Excellent stay","I and my wife stayed at this resort in August 2010 while on our honeymoon trip. It is located in the backyard of kovalam beach. Eventhough the route to reach this hotel is bit remote, this resort is quite awesome for stay and it includes all amenities like massage centre, swimming pool, indoor games etc., We had our breakfast as complimentary. The breakfast too, provided as buffet breakfast with varities like cornflakes, breads, poori etc., Food quality is very good. Dinner can also be provided in buffet. Buffet dinner per head costs 200 Rs (Non-Veg) / 150 Rs (Veg) + taxes. Lively atmosphere. Excellent service. Feel good atmosphere. The room provided to us is very compact with superb interiors. From the balcony, nice view of the sea shore can be seen. Totally excellent stay for us.",5,August 2010
Property needs renovation,"It looks like an old resort. Very poorly maintained. Rooms are in bad shape. Cracks are there on walls, furniture is broken, toilets are very small. Food is expensive. Ashoka Beach is nearby. Main beach(lighthouse beach) is 15 mins walking distance. Staff is nice, helpful &amp; courteous.",2,January 2019
Country Club Resort,"Old Property, Requires fresh painting and repair work, The Bath rooms are small, Geysers are of small capacity, hot water gets over quickly, requires change in bed lenin and towels, improved toiletry is also required.Good staff, helpful staff, accommodates customer requests",3,March 2017
Good location and service,We enjoyed our stay at country club Kovalam.. service was really good.. very friendly and helping staff made our stay very comfortable..Will recommend this place..The restaurant has all type of cuisines and taste is also good..,5,February 2017
Dont go by its approach road....its just ok,"Overall experience was ok, not bad. Food is good and reasonable rates. Room sizes are ok but toilets are cramped up, however overall maint and service was good. Approach to the resort is through a very narrow lane. Beach is nearby but again approach to beach is bad and track is not maintained.",3,November 2016
Serene - Calm - BlissFul,"This place is Near the Kovalam Beach and Spread over a huge area...there are good trees, garden pathways to lead through the entire resort and well maintained swimming pools as well as friendly staff. Would recommend this place for those wanting to take a break from regular routine and spend some time with nature.",4,April 2016
Mr Sru,"Property is good and well maintained. It's good in all aspects like staff behaviour, information sharing etc. But, I felt it is little interior. Although behind ashoka beach, the road to go to resort in the night is not recommended. From kovalam main road route, its interior like 1 km(auto will charge 80rs , that option is anyway available). Overall its very good one considering all facilities.",4,February 2016
Totaly good experience,"Its a very good property in peaceful place and i have totally enjoyed my stay over there,and staffs are very cooperative and friendly they are always ready to help you and guide you,i really enjoyed the stay next summer also am planning to come there for Ayurveda treatment",5,March 2016
good hotel & location,"Room was good and staffs are very nice,Ayurvedic spa with fair rates is the main attraction.we have enjoyed the stay and auto and taxi available at any time and front office staff is ready help always",4,March 2016
Bad place to stay for non members,"We were two families that stayed here for 3 nights. Our package included breakfast but no other meals. The first shocker that we got was that for people who had not paid in advance for meals could not get food in the hotel at all. This didn't sound nice at all as the location of the resort is also a problem. Walking out at night with family in the dark outside the hotel did not look nice at all. The breakfast options were very limited and mostly the food was already cold by the time it was put on the table. They had some issue with the restaurant for few days and therefore the food was served in a make shift place in a dry pool (that may have been in use earlier). The staff was quick to say ""Sorry but we can't help you"" for most things that we asked.  The good things: - The cottage was nice with an alternate room attached with the bedroom- One can walk down to the beach (during the day) if required- we discovered two small but nice restaurants near by that offer good food",3,December 2015
Absolutely pathetic resort with lot of things to hate !,My views: 1. No sign boards to reach this place. 2. Worst food and its services3. Rooms are at its worst. No proper room service. Never book it. Lot of things mentioned in the resort will either be not available or would be under renovation. Even the WiFi is not available ! This place is not even worth half the price they are offering.,1,December 2015
Poor spa and badness resort in the world...!!!,"I m very shocking while I m staying with my family at 16th and 17th December 2015. They upload  photos are good in travel website but after facing all things are different. Low maintained property. Swimming pool are in the dirty condition. Rooms are bad, Air condition is loudly high...it is like a fan. Rooms service are very poor. No response while we call about issues.          Restaurant having only 2 staff members. They take your order and they served the food. Restaurant manager behavior are very bad....non co-operative nature...he is very akdu having dadagiri with customers. TV and TV remotes are in the damage condition. Bath towels are dirty conditions. All furniture are in damage condition.        I think very bad experience in my life after staying in this poor hotel...!!!!",1,December 2015
Good and neete the rooms are small,"Rooms are small But neat bout no activities for kids its only for staying accommodations only restaurant is good bout bit expensive staffs are good, very close to Ashoka and leala beach vocable No free axes from amine road",3,December 2015
USELESS STAFFS & UTTER WASTE ROOM & HOSPITALITY,"I booked through makemytrip and checked in on 11th of December 2015.The worst and terrible experience ever.Staff are very rude. Dont even have a courtesey towards customers. Just like attittute showing "" If you want, stay and GO... This is all we can do""Rooms are terrible... no maintenance,.... walls, door locks are broken. we took 5 rooms, and condition of all rooms are same... Television not working in rooms. AC not working proprerly. Not even a bottle of water is kept in the room.When we checkd in, two rooms, bathrooms were not clean... coachroaches inside room and bathrooms, Asked to clean it,, housekeeping came but no use... they are telling it can be done only like this... Ordered food for dinner... Worst food I have ever had..... Swimming pool, If we see it we dont even go near it. Full of dirt and chlorine ... Water is full misty......Long way to walk to beach and the way to the beach is in between heavy bushes.....even get afraid to go through....OVERALL... The worst resort I had ever stayed in my LIFE..... Please dont prefer this even for low budget stay.....",1,December 2015
Very Nice Resort & Staff,Obviously am not expecting any 5 star facilities from a 3 star hotel but for the money you are spending its a excellent resort and restaurant food is good and its nice to enjoy rain view from the rooms,5,December 2015
"Nice Property but needs maintenance, Relaxing Stay","The location of this resort is very nice on Ashoka beach.Resort is well connected to Ashoka beach and nearby beached Kovalam beach, Hawa Beach and Light House beach. Always prefer Top floor rooms on building 4 and 5 from where you see Ashoka beach clearly and in the night can hear the sound of sea waves.We visited in the starting of Aug'15 and rooms are under maintenance. There is smell of seepage in the room. On daily basis rooms required cleaning and air freshener.I have membership of Country Clubs but I am not very happy with this visit. Rooms must have good aroma so guest stay in clean and fresh environment.The staff is very nice as this is in Kerala and Kerala people are very nice and gentle.In the month of August, go to Kovalam beach for superb Sunset view. If you are lucky and there is no cloud, you will get the awesome view of sunset equivalent to Kanyakumari.",4,August 2015
Enjoyed my stay..,Pros: Has a backdoor exit to beach (total 5 mins walk).Breakfast is good.Rooms are clean and spacious.Has a free Wifi Zone.Cons:The road connecting to the hotel is very narrow.No Shops or ggood restraunts nearby.,4,November 2013
"Good property, very poor Maintenance","Had to ask for basic things when checked in and then gave up after making 3 calls for each one of them. Bathroom not clean, no Fridge, tea kettle, cutlery , AC remote not working. Slow service in the restaurant, leaking roof, battered furniture. No WiFi in the rooms. Namesake path to the beach from the back and difficult road from the front. Auto charges Rs 100 to come back from the popular Lighthouse beach after dinner where we had walked down to. Recreation room and pool seem to be under maintenance for long time.",2,October 2013
Location is nice,"Location and interior of rooms and restaurant are nice. Service of food and hotel are bad. Quality of food is bad. Resort is nice with swimming pool. Beaches are well and nice to visit in Kovalam.We booked ""Beach View Superior"" rooms but waste. Hotel is far from beach so can't see beach properly.",3,March 2013
SO SO Experience,"i stayed for 2 nights, when i entere in to resort feel like some eco-resort nice ambiance, nice swimming pool, well maintained land scape. but compare to landscape room are not so good as they required some more maintanance and proper services. as this located on Ashok Beach for which one has cross mountanious kachha road as this is mostly for kovallam beach hotels but this road can be maintain and need some modification by property owner. Except breakfast food is not so good with very less quantity.",3,March 2013
Pathetic Service,"I visited this property towards end of feb when it was already quite hot and weather was pretty humid as well. Overall seemed to me like a budget hotel and worst experience here was the restaurant service. We went for dinner at 10.15pm and by 10.30pm the A/c shut automatically! The manager very casually said it was a usual practice and also few of the items in the food had finished by then and they refused to serve anymore of the same... Just manage with the leftovers... Pretty bad experience and definitely wont visit myself, recommend the same to others reading this as well.",3,February 2013
waste of money and time.,"the beach is 100 mtr from hotel cant go after dark,  restaurent services not good staff is also not helpful.. Spa services are not full of committment.  no restaurent is nearby have to go by car only or manage with inside restaurent only.rooms are good and spacious. Swimming pool is fine. After evening cant go for evening walk or for roam around its dark all over. One shold go for anyother resort. Sta",2,January 2013
None friendly for senior citizen,"Staff at Country Spa Wellness Beach Resort are helpful and friendly, we stayed in 2weeks but    Wi Fi in the rooms never worked even after reporting. Otherwise place is well maintained, located near the beach. Rooms are spacious but the double bed in the room was very low for senior citizen to get in and out of bed. The resort is very pleasant surrounded by lot of coconut trees.",3,January 2013
only rooms are good,only rooms are good..... but service and food is very bad.... specially room service is most poor....location is average... overall average experience....spa is very good... i hd graet experience of spa in country spa....,3,November 2012
A good place to relax,Our this stay of the family tour was probably the best in the trip. The property is well maintained. Nicely located on seaside hill top. Rooms are spacious. Spa is really relaxing and swimming pools separately for adults and kids also provide good relaxation. They also have indoor sports area with plenty of options to play.,5,May 2012
